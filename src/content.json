    "body": "Identified the “Study Abroad Black Box”—a fragmented student journey across test prep, university selection, and financing. Conceptualized Leap GPS (Global Pathway System) to unify LeapScholar and LeapFinance into a single, data-driven pathway. Built as an extra-mile case study to demonstrate structured problem-solving, product judgment under ambiguity, and AI-first thinking. While conceptual, it showcases my ability to turn high-anxiety, siloed journeys into transparent decision frameworks.",
